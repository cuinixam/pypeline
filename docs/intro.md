Pypeline is a Python application designed to streamline and automate the software development lifecycle, particularly the pipeline execution processes across various environments such as GitHub and Jenkins.
The primary motivation for developing Pypeline stemmed from the need to unify and simplify the creation of build, test, and deployment pipelines that are traditionally defined separately across these platforms using GitHub workflows (YAML) and Jenkins pipelines (Jenkinsfile).

**Key Features**

- **Unified Pipeline Definition**: Users can define their entire pipeline in a single YAML file, eliminating the need to switch between different syntaxes and configurations for different CI/CD tools.

- **Extensibility**: Pypeline supports execution steps defined not only through local scripts but also from installed Python packages.

- **Execution Context**: Each step in the pipeline receives an execution context that can be updated during step execution. This allows for the sharing of information and state between steps.

- **Dependency Handling**: Dependency management ensures that only the necessary steps are executed, reducing runtime and resource usage by avoiding unnecessary operations.

- **Ease of Use**: With Pypeline, setting up and running pipelines becomes more straightforward, enabling developers to focus more on coding and less on configuring pipeline specifics.
