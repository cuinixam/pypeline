# 🔎 Overview

::::{card} 📦 Pypeline

Pypeline lets you define your build, test, and deployment pipeline in a single YAML file and run it _consistently_ across your local development environment and _any_ CI/CD platform.

**Quick Start**

```shell
pipx install pypeline-runner
pypeline init --project-dir my-pipeline
cd my-pipeline
pypeline run
```

See the [First Pipeline Tutorial](tutorials/first_pipeline.md) for a complete walkthrough.
